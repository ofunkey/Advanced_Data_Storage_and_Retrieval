# Advanced_Data_Storage_and_Retrieval - Surfs Up!
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do.

## 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration
In this analysis, Python, SQLAlchemy and Matplotlib are used for the data exploration of your climate database. 
* Database: hawaii.sqlite file
* Create_engine to connect to your sqlite database using SQLAlchemy.
* Reflect the tables into classes and save a reference to those classes

### Precipitation Analysis
* Retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.
* Select only the date and prcp values.
* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.
* Sort the DataFrame values by date.
* Plot the results using the DataFrame plot method.
*Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data
